# Production Engineering - Week 1 - Portfolio Site

Hello everyone, we are the Python Panthers and this is our little portfolio site that we have created for our orientation hackathon for the MLH Fellowship! We are Maansi, Josh and Juliette who are fellows in Pod 22.SUM.20 in the Production Engineering track.

## Technologies Used
- Flask (jinja templates)
- HTML, CSS (for styles), and Python with the Flask framework
- Git, for remote collaboration, pull requests, creating issues and merging our codes

## Demo
Here is the link for our Devpost submission where you will see a little demo we had filmed to showcase our portfolio site.
